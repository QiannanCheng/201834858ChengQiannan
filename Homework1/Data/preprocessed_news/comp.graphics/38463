from rw cs.arizona.edu ronald w schmidt subject outlin spline surfac about year ago i start work problem appear veri simpl turn out quit difficult i am wonder anyon net ha seen problem hopefulli some publish solut problem draw outlin surfac defin two roughli parallel cubic spline input problem essenti start two set point where each set point edg object which we treat two dimension i. onli extant between edg which exist three dimension space draw object we fit cubic spline through point each spline effect comput sequenc line segment approxim curv each spline ha equal number segment we assum nth segment along each spline roughli exactli same distanc along each spline ani reason measur take each segment n along each spline match nth segment oppos spline us pair segment form two triangl which fill color surfac depth sort triangl take each triangl sort order project onto d pixmap draw color triangl take edg triangl along edg surfac draw line along edg color special edg color edg color step heart problem idea effect outlin edg surfac net result howev gener ha lot break gap edg surfac reason fairli complic involv both raster problem problem result from project spline anyth about problem sound familiar we would appreci know about other work area thank
