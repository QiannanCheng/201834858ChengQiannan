worth sai twenti martian intent take over world my famili all them balanc act here hard judg sit my desk howev anoth problem ani case civil war strength militia fight each side should reflect popular public split versu minor militia should disadvantag need popular support would hopefulli prevent insurrect unless peopl realli were behind rebel heavi weapon own small fraction militia could distort what minor includ all tank artilleri owner seem case alreadi given heavi weapon aren't commonli own citizenri low number obvious due cost i don't think superior weapon go great effect against numer superior foe furthermor even more doubt train includ proper tactic movement best util tank wherea commonli rifleman so hamper effect i think vital avoid situat where small minor would have reason chanc gain polit power through violenc prevent mai necessari give control heavi weapon e.g those which onli small number individu would own _and_ whose firepow would grossli distort relat between popular support militari strength someon other individu militiamen certainli good thing i think lesser two evil whoever control weapon must democrat bodi respons peopl i had envis armor perhap offic select group like would exercis control over heavier more complex weapon joe bob own old sherman tank i certainli wouldn't ask him give up follow order from offic ye sinc expens tank so larg though chanc would jointli purchas should therefor jointli maintain oper here i think we have careful about _which_ state we talk about certainli on role militia overthrow repress govern would complet destruct end same govern control militia' arm unit state have sever level govern each abl act independ all like target rebelion rebelion against state local govern veri unlik i think therefor state possibl local govern could safe allow keep select militia' heavi weapon risk abus while still someth consid far less than similar risk were feder govern control i'll agre point state have control over heavi weapon should justif state have them central locat keep them spread out abil state lock them up isn't so easi otherwis i would have assum state control would rest author governor militia offic eaxctli why i think should remov select militia should privid militia' heavi weapon highli train specialist reason i have outlin abov i think heavi weapon tank artilleri aircraft etc better off be kept local govern than small number individu howev local govern shouldn't abl us select militia without support peopl ideal gener militia under direct control peopl select militia under direct democrat local govern would opper togeth even worst case gener militia should abl function without select militia similarli select militia should incap action without aid gener militia i'm have hard time see how heavi weapon fairli few number could easili wield few peopl govern support just you argu abov weapon should divvi up under democrat control so on side doesn't have all them i can't see where situat allevi have select militia hold all weapon unorgan militia be infantri i think better mix call i would argu feder armi should reli upon select militia unorgan militia bulk it infantri unit consid effect remov nation guard' infantri place guard under control local govern govern control select militia could fight effect without infantri support provid gener militia inher infantri organ other hand gener militia could function although disadvantag without back local govern select militia we have assum would those who would side govern control forc they'v all equip infantri forc
