acknowledg subject impress btw my beef your baysian argument mathemat on i check most your work didn't find error you seem veri care so probabl isn't math mistak i think mistak philosoph just make sure i understand you can pleas rephras non technic term i think reason request i alwai try look wai explain physic non physicist i'm baysian statistician nor ani type statistician so would veri help

mean word i'll explain bear mind isn't central all i requir theism make predict appear god s never happen doe atheism befor somebodi point out quantum mechan doesn't make predict either differ qm atheism do form partit predict includ statement prayer efficaci impli you do stat you find prayer efficaci prayer efficaci verili i sai unto you gener shall pass till all thing fulfil i don't think we have ani problem misunderstand here persist observ stuff happen consist ht though mai more consist ha explain bayesian stat post even ht god exist unfalsifi that' problem my argument other than you have let number observ go infin falsifi asymptot btw i do consid argument requir infinit number observ valid rather part argument valid we exist human can never make infinit number measur ani conclus reili i don't accept valid that' fine i don't claim theism fals mere finit number observ avail me so far suggest i continu observ suggest look better better renorm stuff delet bayesian stat post i assum theism inde unfalsifi finit number observ here' relev quot import assumpt some observ which compat theist hypothesi atheist hypothesi thu would falsifi atheism what i call appear god s need taken too liter ani observ which requir it explan on more god exist count all other observ assum compat both hypothes leav theism unfalsifi atheism falsifi singl observ onli appear god s here my problem someth falsifi must make predict x should seen x seen hypothesi ha been falsifi now atheism word oposit someth theism theism asert belief atheism asert disbelief so certain atheism certainli falsifi just certain theism falsif e.g my theism assert world onli year old god doe deciev ha been falsifi howev atheism oposit unfalsifi theism also unfalsifi i could wrong statment contd i think you appear god s suffici falsifi atheism wherea gener correspond theism unfalsifi i'll think more about until here gener question supps x were unfalsifi x also unfalsifi wai counterexampl let x coin fair more accur so x make sens two side coin differ unfalsifi toss coin even string head consist fair coin you have go infinit number toss falsifi x limit it convers falsifi falsifi when least on head least on tail have appear partli what' wrong you baysian argument which requir observ x x n made simpli observ have truth valu relat statement god exist now us your symmetri argument i can understand why someon would sai sinc statement god doe exist make predict i choos believ none less would found type faith you don't like word faith insert belief which falsifi evid instead i'll assum you meant god exist up highlight our agre definit exist statement make predict i said abov although isn't falsifi finit number observ actual i mean god doe exist make predict oop sorri mea culpa truth statment actual depend upon which god you refer i can think some concept god which true onc again i'm open posibl i could wrong so give me some exampl predict statment god doe exist here on i can think true would heal miricl can principl never determin on wai other case which peopl seem recov heal without help doctor known reason situat do fact happen consist theistic hypothesi wai support hypothesi we agre here inconsist atheist hypothesi i can't think on predict from god doe exist isn't type i might miss someth raptur happen octob said raptur would have falsifi atheism my satisfact had happen although it failur happen doe cours falsifi ani theism other than those which specif predict phenomenon which requir exist on more god it explan ever observ about sum whole thing up bob singleton bob
