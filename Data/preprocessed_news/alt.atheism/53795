examin case evid whatsoev ani thing big heart alterian benefactor howev p exist b h b p exist b h b ground lack_of_evidence_for evidence_against when we have partit like we dismiss hypothesi turn therefor b we also find evid support hypothesi same ground befor we dismiss hypothesi b problem we have dismiss all possibl hypothes even though we know construct monei arriv everi month we have proven can't becaus we have dismiss all it potenti caus that' extrem poor argument here' why premis monei be paid you either your big heart alterian benefactor b bug alterian atm thu each monthli appear buck should happen observ alteriu construct evid exist either benefactor bug atm premis observ alteriu possibl except bank you couldn't possibl afford you forgot includ my premis actual premis cardin set possibl observ alteriu on clearli contradictori first you state properli troubl basi premis you sai can evid either benefactor bug first premis lead conclus appear buck should happen evid exist either benefactor bug voila scream contradict my highlight sc strawman argument onli evid oneof benefactor bug observ distinguish benefactor from bug possibl evid bug neither evid benefactor nor true sai hypothet univers appear exactli were benefactor bug two statement both would fals still contradictori reduc alterian dosh arriv my account due benefactor bug evid benefactor neither evid bug mean doesn't lend more weight on than other therefor evid can exist benefactor evid can exist bug reli shift mean from when you sai paraphras evid benefactor exampl what you mean it' more evid benefactor than bug ye that' what i mean howev you'v shift mean evid benefactor so now mean absolut evid benefactor rather than rel evid benefactor w.r.t bug realli i meant evid would tend on over other i think just commun problem what i am try sai my clumsi wai while i bui your theori far relat theism make predict prayer your raptur exampl i don't bui your us occam' razor all case where my exampl on couldn't dismiss benefactor bug ground simplic on necessari explain dosh i brought up on on dismiss process show would wrong do so from what you'r sai post seem you agre we'r talk cross purpos still contradict some sum mai help b benefactor b bug d dosh arriv account impli p b b d assum p bb d so it' either benefactor bug which respons buck arriv both p b b d p b d p b d so p b d p b d impli p b d p b d isn't what i meant p b d p b d necessarili new observ we'v alreadi seen dosh chang those estim i try sai again my clumsi wai would _wrong_ assign probabl either that' precis what us razor doe case god god on class hypothesi mani other belong set hypothes _one_of_which_ necessari explain someth which otherwis would _not_ satisfactorili explain can thrown out retain ground non ration prefer scienc statist altern on could chuck out retain lot ground answer can't known notion probabl estim effect useless be equal agnostic weak atheism do when set m fill univers caus x where x god pink unicorn noth etc observ tend on conclus over other exactli point i make i think so we don't throw out ani contrari your assert abov we do some peopl do simon think do excel scienc my sole point aren't onli observ which directli contradict hypothesi h i i. x where p x h i can caus p h i go zero after finit number observ onli case do we get throw ani hypothes out exactli my point though i mai have been unclear you said diametr opposit which i guess sourc my confus i mere try illustr incorrect do so what i'm try sai while you correct sai absenc evid can sometim evid absenc doe hold true all perhap ani version theism isn't true those which doe hold can discard us razor contrari those which doe hold exactli those which can discard us razor see my post other branch thread you seem guilti contradict you accus me razor hold god hold all like hypothes which mean you'r assign p x h i all i though we'v alreadi establish it' correct do so when sum p x h i over all i simpli put anyon who claim have viabl proof exist non exist god whether induct best mistaken worst bark mad luckili i make claim have specif said much numer occas you wouldn't construct strawman here would you frank although doesn't cours rule out my be bark mad ani case i could bark mad my spare time apolog clees et al i think you miss point onc again when i sai someth evid against hypothesi doesn't impli observ said someth necessarili falsifi hypothesi reduc estim p h data zero reduc quantiti it' still evid against h i got i'm talk about case when you'r clearli correct when i'm construct strawman though it' certainli possibl i'v misunderstood what you'r sai howev ani standard system sai when god highli unlik when god can dismiss us razor system purport induct proof god either don't exist unnecessari explain ani all phenomena my experi system includ those which purport prove god exist alwai contain fallaci upon close examin that' what you'r sai pleas put me straight frank o'dwyer i'm hatch odwyer
