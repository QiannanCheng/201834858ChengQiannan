from dino inqmind.bison.mb.ca toni stewart subject re voltag regul current limit acollin uclink.berkeley.edu andi collin write on so quick question throw out you gui our class project we need design build power suppli follow spec voltatg adjust from v current limit voltag must stai within design valu i from ac rippl less than mv rm cours we can't just us adjust voltag current limit regul chip our problem current limit i. we'v found stuff do rest part circuit what suppli must do present load which would draw more than given suppli voltag reduc voltag so current equal on amp thu we were short thing ammet we should read on amp we measur current through ohm resistor v we should read on amp output voltag necess must v onli basic idea we have seen current limit involv circuit which pull current off base output power transistor therefor reduc output so doe anybodi have ani idea we could work from thank advanc andi collin kc yei acollin uclink.berkeley.edu ps anybodi want flame stupid project i agre fulli i still have do it grade you can design ramp shutoff brick wall current limit even fold back cutoff sound like you want brick wall current limit your lead correct pull down bia seri regul base drive order get brick wall you need enough voltag gain current sensor normal darlington current sens resistor adequ infinit gain us op amp sens current rele stabl voltag refer us driver turn off base bia seri pass transistor phase compens mai necessari close loop control system yopu have more than degre phase shift your feedabck circuit uniti gain ok dino inqmind.bison.mb.ca inquir mind bb winnipeg manitoba
